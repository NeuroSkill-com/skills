# NeuroSkill Skill Index

NeuroSkill is a biometric AI companion powered by a real-time EEG device.
It reads brainwaves and physiology continuously, and uses that data to inform every response.

NeuroSkill exposes the EEG analysis API through a local WebSocket server and HTTP tunnel.
The `npx neuroskill <command>` script is the fastest way to query it from a terminal, shell
script, or any automation pipeline.

Skills are loaded contextually — the harness injects the relevant skill file into the
system prompt when the user's message matches the skill's domain.

## EEG Data & API Skills

| Skill | Loaded when | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [neuroskill-transport](skills/neuroskill-transport/SKILL.md) | transport/connection questions | WebSocket & HTTP transport, port discovery, Quick Start, output modes (`--json` / `--full`), and global CLI flags. |
| [neuroskill-status](skills/neuroskill-status/SKILL.md) | status/device questions | `status` command — full system snapshot: device state, signal quality, EEG scores, band powers, ratios, embeddings, labels, sleep summary, and recording history. |
| [neuroskill-sessions](skills/neuroskill-sessions/SKILL.md) | session/history questions | `session` and `sessions` commands — per-session metric breakdowns with first/second-half trends, session listing, and Unix timestamp helpers. |
| [neuroskill-search](skills/neuroskill-search/SKILL.md) | comparison/trend questions | `search` and `compare` commands — ANN search for neurally similar EEG moments across all history, and A/B session comparison with metric deltas and UMAP enqueuing. |
| [neuroskill-sleep](skills/neuroskill-sleep/SKILL.md) | sleep/fatigue context | `sleep` and `umap` commands — EEG-based sleep stage classification (Wake/N1/N2/N3/REM) with efficiency and bout analysis, and 3D UMAP projection for spatial session comparison. |
| [neuroskill-labels](skills/neuroskill-labels/SKILL.md) | label/search context | `label`, `search-labels`, and `interactive` commands — creating EEG text annotations, semantic vector search over labels, and cross-modal 4-layer graph search combining text and EEG similarity. |
| [neuroskill-streaming](skills/neuroskill-streaming/SKILL.md) | streaming/calibration/TTS context | `say`, `listen`, `notify`, `calibrate`, `calibrations`, `timer`, and `raw` commands — on-device TTS speech, real-time WebSocket event streaming, OS notifications, calibration profile management, focus timer, and raw JSON passthrough. |
| [neuroskill-data-reference](skills/neuroskill-data-reference/SKILL.md) | metric field questions | All metric fields — band powers, EEG ratios and indices, core scores, complexity measures, PPG/HRV, motion and artifact markers, sleep stage codes, neurological indices, and consciousness metrics. |
| [neuroskill-recipes](skills/neuroskill-recipes/SKILL.md) | scripting/automation questions | Use-case recipes and scripting patterns — focus monitoring, stress tracking, sleep analysis, cognitive load queries, meditation tracking, A/B comparison, time-range queries, and automation with cron/Python/Node.js/HTTP. |

## Protocol & Intervention Skills

| Skill | Loaded when | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [neuroskill-protocols](skills/neuroskill-protocols/SKILL.md) | protocol/exercise/routine intent detected | Full guided-protocol repertoire — 70+ mind-body practices matched to EEG metric signals. Covers breathing, meditation, stress regulation, sleep, somatic work, emotions, music, neck/eye/morning exercises, workout protocols, hydration, dietary guidance, and social-media/digital-addiction interventions. Loaded on-demand when the user asks for help, exercises, routines, or specific practices. |

## Tools Available to the Agent

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `neuroskill_run` | Run any neuroskill EEG command and return its output. |
| `neuroskill_label` | Create a timestamped EEG annotation for the current moment (supports `--context` and `--at` flags). |
| `run_protocol` | Execute a multi-step guided protocol with OS notifications, per-step timing, and EEG labelling. |
| `prewarm` | Kick off a background `npx neuroskill compare` run so results are ready when needed. |
| `memory_read` | Read the agent's persistent memory file. |
| `memory_write` | Write or append to the agent's persistent memory file. |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch a URL and return its content. |
| `web_search` | Search the web and return results. |

## How Contextual Loading Works

On every user message, the harness:
1. Runs `npx neuroskill status` and injects the live EEG snapshot into the system prompt.
2. Detects domain signals in the user's prompt (stress, sleep, focus, protocols, etc.).
3. Runs the relevant neuroskill commands in parallel (neurological, session, search-labels, etc.).
4. If protocol intent is detected, reads `skills/neuroskill-protocols/SKILL.md` and injects
   the full protocol repertoire into the system prompt for that turn.
5. Injects this skill index so the LLM always knows what capabilities are available.
